üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites

Node.js (v18.17 or later)

Python (v3.8 or later)

A Google Gemini API Key

1. Backend Setup

First, set up and start the Python backend server.

# 1. Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# 2. Create a Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# 3. Install the required Python libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Create an environment file
# Create a file named .env in the `backend` directory and add your API key:
# GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"

# 5. Run the backend server
# The server will run on [http://127.0.0.1:10000](http://127.0.0.1:10000)
uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 10000 --reload


2. Frontend Setup

In a new terminal, set up and start the Next.js frontend.

# 1. Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# 2. Install the necessary npm packages
npm install

# 3. Run the development server
# The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000
npm run dev


3. Usage

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.

Enter your name and click "Start Exam".

The frontend will fetch a question from the backend and start the timer.

Write your code in the syntax-highlighted editor.

Click "Submit Final Answer" to have your code graded and the score saved to the SQLite database.

4. Viewing the Dashboard

To view the results stored in the database:

# 1. In your backend terminal (with the virtual environment active),
#    stop the main server (Ctrl+C).

# 2. Run the Streamlit dashboard app
streamlit run dashboard.py


This will open a new browser tab with the results dashboard.
